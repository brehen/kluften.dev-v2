			<p>
				After a brief stint at JProfessionals where I wasn't able to secure any projects, I made the
				decision to join Capra with the hope of finding more meaningful work. The initial months
				proved challenging with no assignments, but this allowed me to dedicate myself full-time to
				completing my Master's Thesis. In a stroke of perfect timing, I landed a project on the very
				day I submitted my thesis.
