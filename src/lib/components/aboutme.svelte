				<p>
					I graduated OsloMet with a degree in Computer Science in 2017. My first job was as a consultant on the
					ServiceNow platform, creating custom Portals for our customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since then, I&apos;ve found and cultivated a passion for modern web development. React, NextJS, Tailwind,
					Vitest and Tanstack Query are among my favorite technologies to work with at the moment. At Dr.Dropin,
					I&apos;ve introduced and implemented most of these technologies with great success.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have three lovely pets, two british shorthairs: Linux and Gatsby, and a Shiba Inu - Neko.&nbsp;<span

					Outside of work I can either be found in the kitchen, in front of a video game, around a board game or at a
					table of D&D. Maybe at our cottage.
