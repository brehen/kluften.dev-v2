        <p>
          Having spent all my career as a consultant, I decided I wanted to try
          out being an inhouse developer. I decided to start working for
          Dr.Dropin, a startup that aims to disrupt the current state of our
          healthcare industry. As a part of a completely new development
          department, I became resonsible for our web page, running on Sanity
          and GatsbyJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the projects I&apos;ve been responsible for since starting:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Theseus - our component library. Built with Storybook, React,
            TypeScript and Rollup. Currently used across all our frontend
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            DrDropin.no - Built with GatsbyJS and Sanity. Successfully
            implemented new design and rehauled the booking flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            New booking web app - Built with NextJS, TypeScript, React Query,
            Zustand. Second phase of rehauling the booking flow includes
            splitting into a separate web app, based on NextJS.
          </li>

        <p>
          After a couple of years developing web applications on ServiceNow, I
          decided to follow my passion for more modern web development and got
          the opportunity to do this at ITverket. I&apos;m currently hired out
          as a react consultant, helping our customers develop amazing front-end
          applications.

        <p>
          I worked as a web developer throughout the full stack of the
          ServiceNow platform. This entailed configuring and maintaining the
          server-side (backend code/databases/workflows) while portraying
          enterprise data in meaningful and intuitive layouts in the service
          portal (AngularJS frontend). Iâ€™ve also arranged multiple courses on
          developing Service Portal Widgets for colleagues interested in
          learning about developing custom widgets for our projects.

        <p>
          Shortly after delivering and presenting my final project for my CS
          degree, I started working for Syscom as a consultant developing on the
          ServiceNow platform for a couple of customers during the summer. Moved
          on to a part-time position while starting on a Master&apos;s Degree at
          UiO, but after the first semester, I got a great job offer and decided
          to end my studies to pursue a career as a ServiceNow consultant.
